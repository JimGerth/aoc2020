# Advent Of Code 2020

This is my little christmas holiday project trying to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) by doing this years [*Advent of Code*](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I'm a little limited in my time due to university and work, so I'm already behind the *one-puzzle-per-day* schedule, but I hope I will get to all the challenges eventually.

## Run

Simply `git clone` this repository and use `cargo run <puzzle number>` to compute the answer to the challenge of the given day.
